		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Initialize Expo Project and Clean Setup",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Expo project initialization into: 1) Execute create-expo-app with blank template, 2) Create and run reset-project.js cleanup script, 3) Remove TypeScript configurations and ensure JavaScript setup, 4) Verify project runs on both iOS and Android simulators",
			"reasoning": "This is a straightforward setup task with well-defined steps. Project is currently empty (no Expo files found), making this a greenfield initialization requiring basic CLI commands and file cleanup operations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Install and Configure Core Dependencies",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down dependency installation into: 1) Install camera and haptics Expo packages, 2) Install axios for API calls, 3) Install bottom-sheet and its peer dependencies (reanimated, gesture-handler), 4) Configure babel.config.js for reanimated plugin, 5) Verify all packages compatibility and resolve any conflicts",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity due to peer dependency management and babel configuration requirements. Bottom-sheet setup with reanimated often requires careful configuration to avoid common issues."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Full-Screen Camera Preview",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down camera implementation into: 1) Set up camera permissions flow with proper error handling, 2) Create Camera component with back camera configuration, 3) Implement full-screen styling with StatusBar hiding, 4) Handle permission denied state with user-friendly messaging, 5) Test on multiple device sizes for proper aspect ratio coverage",
			"reasoning": "Camera implementation requires permission handling, device-specific considerations for full-screen display, and proper error states. Edge-to-edge display can be tricky across different device types."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Create Capture Button with Hold Animation",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down button implementation into: 1) Create base TouchableOpacity with circular styling and positioning, 2) Implement press/release event handlers with duration tracking, 3) Add scale animation for button shrinking during press, 4) Create rotating colorful border animation with Animated.loop, 5) Implement 3-5 second hold timer logic with proper cleanup, 6) Test animation performance and timing accuracy",
			"reasoning": "Complex animation choreography with multiple animated values, timing controls, and state management. Requires careful coordination of scale, color rotation, and timing logic while maintaining 60fps performance."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Haptic Feedback System",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down haptic integration into: 1) Import and configure expo-haptics module, 2) Implement continuous light haptics during button hold with interval management, 3) Add success notification haptic on capture trigger, 4) Handle devices without haptic support gracefully",
			"reasoning": "Relatively simple integration with clear API usage patterns. Main complexity is managing the interval timing and ensuring proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Photo Capture and OpenAI API Integration",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down API integration into: 1) Implement photo capture with base64 conversion and quality optimization, 2) Create API service module with proper configuration and error handling, 3) Format OpenAI request with detailed outfit analysis prompt, 4) Parse and validate JSON response structure, 5) Handle API errors and edge cases (rate limits, network failures), 6) Store API key securely in constants file, 7) Test with various photo types for validation logic",
			"reasoning": "Complex integration involving image processing, API communication, detailed prompt engineering, and comprehensive error handling. Response parsing and validation adds additional complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Build Collapsible Bottom Modal UI",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down modal implementation into: 1) Configure BottomSheet with dual snap points (25%, 90%), 2) Implement loading state with ActivityIndicator, 3) Create collapsed view with outfit name, description, and rating display, 4) Style modal with rounded corners and shadows, 5) Handle sheet position tracking and gesture callbacks, 6) Test swipe gestures and content transitions",
			"reasoning": "Bottom sheet implementation requires careful state management between collapsed/expanded views, smooth gesture handling, and content switching between loading and results states."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Create Recommendations Feed Component",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down feed implementation into: 1) Create FlatList with vertical scroll configuration, 2) Design recommendation card component with image, text hierarchy, and price display, 3) Implement renderItem function with proper styling and shadows, 4) Add text truncation for long descriptions, 5) Optimize image loading and scroll performance",
			"reasoning": "Standard FlatList implementation with moderate complexity in card design and performance optimization for image-heavy content. Requires attention to UI polish and scroll performance."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement External Browser Navigation",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down browser navigation into: 1) Import Linking API and add onPress handlers to cards, 2) Implement URL validation with canOpenURL before opening, 3) Add error handling for invalid URLs and test app state preservation",
			"reasoning": "Simple implementation using React Native's Linking API. Main considerations are URL validation and basic error handling."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Error Handling and User Feedback",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down error handling into: 1) Create animated error banner component with slide animations, 2) Handle invalid photo responses from API, 3) Implement network/connection error handling, 4) Add auto-dismiss timer logic for banners, 5) Reset camera and UI state after errors, 6) Test various error scenarios and edge cases",
			"reasoning": "Requires comprehensive error handling across multiple failure points with animated UI feedback. Involves state management, animation coordination, and proper cleanup logic."
